I'm a Chemical Engineer, also pursuing my 2nd degree in Computer Engineering.

I found my true calling working with computers and making them work for me. 
I **love** to write these amazing pieces of ✨magic called software.

### 👨‍💻 My current focus 
Currently I'm focused on getting really good with the JavaScript stack to build amazing apps!
 - [ ] Pure Modern JavaScript
 - [ ] React.js
 - [ ] React Native
 - [ ] Node.js
 
### 🎓 Univesity Studies 
Alongside my focused studies, I'm enrolled in these disciplines at my university
 - Algorithms and Data Structures (Python)
 - Databases (Theory and Practice)
 - Applied Electrical Circuits
 - Digital Circuits
 - Programming Paradigms
   - Logical (Prolog)
   - Functional (LISP)
   - Object-Oriented (Python)

### 🤖 To the future
I **really** want to learn more about Machine Learning, Deep Learning and all those cool looking stuff!
It was my main reason for learning Python, albeit these studies are on hold due to me focusing more on JavaScript Stuff. </br>
I also want to learn more about **Flutter** and how it compares to React Native. I also want to make some passive income making apps.</br>
When I feel ready enough I want to land on my first Junior Developer Position on the JavaScript stack. </br>
