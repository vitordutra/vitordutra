I'm a Chemical Engineer, also pursuing my 2nd degree in Computer Engineering.

I'm also a member of Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligente Lab (DARTi Lab) at UFMA.
It's a lab focused on AI research. I'm determined on building amazing data driven apps using advanced Machine Learning Algorithms!

I found my true calling working with computers and making them work for me. 
I **love** to write these amazing pieces of ✨magic called software.

### 👨‍💻 My current focus 
Currently I'm focused on getting really good with the React/Node stack to build amazing apps!
 - [x] HTML5
 - [x] CSS3 - Flexbox, Grid and Animations
 - [x] Sass
 - [ ] Pure Modern JavaScript (Currently Learning)
 - [ ] Node.js
 - [ ] React.js
 - [ ] React Native
 
### 🎓 Univesity Studies 
Alongside my focused studies, I'm enrolled in these disciplines at my university

I also have completed and I am somewhat knowledgeable on the following Computer Science and Math related disciplines:
 - Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
 - Programming Laboratory (C)
 - Calculus
 - Linear Algebra
 - Probability and Statistics
 - Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations
 - Algorithms and Data Structures (Python)
 - Applied Electrical Circuits
 - Digital Circuits
 - Databases (Relational Databases Project and Implementation)
 - Programming Paradigms
   - Logical (Prolog)
   - Functional (LISP)
   - Object-Oriented (Python)

### 🤖 To the future
- I **really** want to learn more about Machine Learning, Deep Learning and all those cool looking stuff! Besides, I have strong theoretical knowledge in single and multivariable calculus, statistics and linear algebra, which altogether are the basis of this area of study. It was my main reason for learning Python, albeit these studies are on hold due to me focusing more on JavaScript Stuff.
- I also want to learn more about **Flutter** and how it compares to React Native. I also want to make some passive income making mobile apps.
- When I feel ready enough I want to land on my first Junior Developer Position using the React/Node stack.


### ⚡ Fun Facts
 🔢 I love math and all math related stuff! </br></br>
