### 👨‍💻 My current focus 
Currently I'm focused on getting really good with the React/Node stack to build amazing apps!
 - [x] HTML5
 - [x] CSS3 - Flexbox, Grid and Animations
 - [x] Sass
 - [ ] Pure Modern JavaScript
 - [ ] React.js
 - [ ] React Native
 - [ ] Node.js
 
### 🎓 Univesity Studies 
Alongside my focused studies, I'm enrolled in these disciplines at my university
 - Algorithms and Data Structures (Python)
 - Databases (Theory and Practice)
 - Applied Electrical Circuits
 - Digital Circuits
 - Programming Paradigms
   - Logical (Prolog)
   - Functional (LISP)
   - Object-Oriented (Python)

### 🤖 To the future
- I **really** want to learn more about Machine Learning, Deep Learning and all those cool looking stuff! Besides, I have strong theoretical knowledge in single and multivariable calculus, statistics and linear algebra, which altogether are the basis of this area of study. It was my main reason for learning Python, albeit these studies are on hold due to me focusing more on JavaScript Stuff.
- I also want to learn more about **Flutter** and how it compares to React Native. I also want to make some passive income making mobile apps.
- When I feel ready enough I want to land on my first Junior Developer Position using the React/Node stack.
